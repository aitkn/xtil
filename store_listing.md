## Short Description (max 132 chars)
Extract content, distill knowledge. AI-powered summaries of any page or video with image analysis, diagrams, chat, and Notion export.

## Detailed Description

xTil (pronounced "ex-til", from **ex**tract + dis**til**l) turns any web page into structured, actionable knowledge — not just a summary, but a full breakdown you can refine, discuss, and share.

**What xTil does**

Open the side panel on any page and xTil extracts the content — articles, GitHub PRs and issues, YouTube videos, Reddit threads, tweets, Google Docs, and more — then produces a multi-section analysis: overview, key takeaways, notable quotes, fact-check notes, and a conclusion. If the content benefits from it, xTil generates Mermaid diagrams (flowcharts, timelines, ER diagrams, pie charts) automatically.

**Image & code analysis**

xTil reads images on the page and incorporates their content into the analysis. Code blocks, diffs, and technical content are handled natively — GitHub PRs get status-aware summaries with merge state and review details.

**Refine with chat**

Every summary is a starting point. Use the built-in assistant to:
• Extend or reduce any section
• Delete sections, images, or diagrams you don't need
• Ask follow-up questions about the content
• Translate the entire summary to your preferred language
• Roll back to any previous version of the conversation

**Export & share everywhere**

• Save to Notion — auto-creates a database with Title, URL, Tags, and full content
• Download as Markdown (.md)
• Copy as rich HTML (paste into Gmail, Docs, Slack with formatting intact)
• Copy as Markdown
• Print / Save as PDF via the browser print dialog

**Bring your own key — no subscription**

xTil works with your own API key. Supported providers:
• OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1, o3, and more)
• Anthropic (Claude Sonnet, Opus, Haiku)
• Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Flash, and more)
• Self-hosted (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

No data leaves your browser except to the LLM provider you choose. No accounts, no tracking, no analytics.

**Content types**

Works on articles, blog posts, documentation, GitHub PRs/issues/discussions, YouTube videos (with transcript), Reddit threads, Twitter/X posts, Facebook posts, Google Docs, and any readable web page.

**Customization**

• Light, dark, or system theme
• Adjustable summary detail level (brief → comprehensive)
• Choose any model your provider offers
• Configure context window size
• Toggle image analysis on/off
