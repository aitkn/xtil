Stop reading 3,000-word articles. Get structured insights in seconds.

xTil turns any web page, video, or PR into a multi-section analysis — key takeaways, fact-checks, diagrams, and more. Then refine with chat and export anywhere.

WHAT YOU GET
Every page produces a structured breakdown: concise overview, key takeaways with bold labels, notable quotes with original language preserved, a fact-check grading claims as verified/contested/unverifiable, pros & cons, and a conclusion. Choose between brief, standard, or detailed analysis — xTil automatically scales the depth to match the content.

PLATFORM AWARENESS
Every platform gets special treatment:
• YouTube — Full transcript summary with clickable timestamp links
• GitHub — Six modes: PRs, issues, code files, repos, commits, and releases
• Reddit — Complete threads with nested comments, scores, and engagement metrics
• Twitter/X — Thread reconstruction with engagement data and notable replies
• Google Docs — Reads content directly from your authenticated session
• Facebook — Extracts posts from feed overlays with reaction counts

BRING YOUR OWN KEY
No subscription. Use the AI you already pay for. Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, xAI, DeepSeek, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM). xTil auto-discovers available models and probes vision capability — image analysis just works.

REFINE WITH CHAT
Ask follow-up questions, request deeper analysis, or explore specific sections. Chat responses are structured with the same quality as the initial summary.

EXPORT ANYWHERE
Copy as Markdown, export to Notion, or print. Your summaries go where you need them.

MAKE IT YOURS
• Light, dark, or system theme — diagrams adapt automatically
• Summarize in any language, or match the source
• Three detail levels: brief, standard, or detailed
